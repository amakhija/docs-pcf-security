This topic describes the sources and uses of certificates to secure both internal and external networking calls in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

## <a id="sources"></a>Certificate Sources

Certificates within PCF originate from two sources:

* Enterprise Root Certificate Authority (CA)

* CredHub

### <a id="enterprise-root-ca"></a>Enterprise Root CA

Most enterprises have mechanisms to generate certificates via an internal process against their root CA. This is a good implementation for systems that are more static in nature and do not have a requirement for the certificate issuing system to be highly available and highly performant at all times.

### <a id="credhub"></a>CredHub

CredHub can be used as a source for certificates within PCF. These certificates can either be self-signed or signed by an imported trusted CA. Use CredHub when:

* High-availability is important
* Dynamic generation of certificates
* Securing communications between platform components, applications, and services

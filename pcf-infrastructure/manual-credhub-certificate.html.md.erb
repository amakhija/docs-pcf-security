title: Reviewing and Resetting Manually Set Certificates in BOSH CredHub
owner: Ops Manager
---

This topic describes how to identify and update certificates that have been manually 
set in BOSH CredHub. 

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

A manually set certificate is a certificate that an operator has added 
directly to BOSH CredHub through the CredHub CLI instead of using 
a CredHub-generated certificate. 

For example, an operator may have provided an existing certificate to BOSH CredHub as described in the 
[Preparing for TLS](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/2-5/prepare-tls.html) procedure 
of the _MySQL for PCF_ documentation.

In the context of Ops Manager API output, a manually set certificate appears
as a configurable certificate. However, to ensure that Ops Manager does not rotate 
these certificates alongside CredHub-generated certificates, 
you must ensure that the `generated` fields of any manually set 
certificates are set to `false` in CredHub.

In this procedure, you use the CredHub CLI to review existing certificates 
and then check for manually set certificates. If you find any manually set certificates 
that require updates, you can use the CredHub CLI to reset the certificate.

###<a id='credhub-creds'></a> Find BOSH Client Credentials and BOSH Director IP Address

You need the BOSH client name and client secret to use the CredHub CLI.

To find the BOSH CredHub client name and client secret, do the following:

1. In the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the BOSH Director tile.
1. Click the **Credentials** tab.
1. In the BOSH Director section, click the link to the BOSH Commandline Credentials.
	![CredHub Credentials](../images/bosh-client-creds.png)
1. Record the values for `BOSH_CLIENT` and `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET`.


	Here is an example of the credentials page:

	```
	{"credential":"BOSH_CLIENT=ops_manager
	BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=abcdefghijklm123456789
	BOSH_CA_CERT=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
	BOSH_ENVIRONMENT=10.0.0.5 bosh "}
	```

1. Click on the **Status** tab.

1. In the BOSH Director row, locate and record the IP address of BOSH Director. For example, `10.0.0.5`.

## <a id="login-credhub"></a> Target and Log in to the BOSH CredHub API Server

You can run CredHub CLI commands on the Ops Manager VM.

To login and access the CredHub API, do the following:

1. SSH into the Ops Manager VM. For IaaS-specific instructions on how to SSH, see
see [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI](../../customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh).

1. Set the CredHub API target of the CLI by running the following command:

    ```
    credhub api https://BOSH-DIRECTOR:8844 --ca-cert=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    ```
    <br>
    Where `BOSH-DIRECTOR` is the IP address of the BOSH Director VM.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ credhub api http<span>s:</span>//10.0.0.5:8844 --ca-cert=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    </pre>

1. Log in to CredHub by running the following command:

    ```
    credhub login --client-name=CREDHUB-CLIENT-NAME --client-secret=CREDHUB-CLIENT-SECRET
    ```
    Where:<br>
    * `CREDHUB-CLIENT-NAME` is the value you recorded for `BOSH_CLIENT` in
    [Find BOSH Client Credentials and BOSH Director IP Address](#credhub-creds) above.
    * `CREDHUB-CLIENT-SECRET` is the value you recorded for `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET` in
    [Find BOSH Client Credentials and BOSH Director IP Address](#credhub-creds) above.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ credhub login \
      --client-name=credhub \
      --client-secret=abcdefghijklm123456789
    </pre>

## <a id="check-credhub-certs"></a> Check Certificates in CredHub

After logging in to CredHub, you can query the CredHub API on the command line.

To retrieve a list of CredHub certificates, do the following:

1. To retrieve a list of all the certificates stored in CredHub, run the following command:

    ```
    credhub curl -p "/api/v1/certificates" -X GET | jq
    ```

1. In the JSON output, check the value of the `generated` field of each certificate. For example:

    ```
  {
    "certificates": [
    {
      "name": "/services/tls_ca",
      "id": "1b378f9c-d3dc-4519-9cde-20397f9d8d6b",
      "versions": [
        {
          "id": "3e41bba8-1373-4b51-b774-d65d9a0b87b4",
          "expiry_date": "2020-09-19T14:36:36Z",
          "transitional": false,
          "certificate_authority": true,
          "self_signed": true,
          "generated": null
        },
     ```

1. For each certificate where `generated` value is `null`, perform the procedure described in 
[Reset a Certificate in CredHub](#reset-certificates).

## <a id="reset-certificates"></a> Reset a Certificate in CredHub

To reset a certificate in CredHub, do the following:

1. Retrieve a manually set certificate by running the following commands:

    ```
    credhub get -n MY-SET-CERTIFICATE -k certificate > /tmp/certificate.yml
    credhub get -n MY-SET-CERTIFICATE -k ca > /tmp/ca.yml
    credhub get -n MY-SET-CERTIFICATE -k private_key > /tmp/private_key.yml
    ```
   Where `MY-SET-CERTIFICATE` is the value of the `name` field in the manually set certificate you want to retrieve.
   <br><br>
   For example:
   <pre class="terminal">
    $ credhub get -n /services/tls_ca -k certificate > /tmp/certificate.yml
    $ credhub get -n /services/tls_ca -k ca > /tmp/ca.yml
    $ credhub get -n /services/tls_ca -k private_key > /tmp/private_key.yml
   </pre>

1. Reset the certificate depending on the certificate type. 
   * If the retrieved certificate is a root CA certificate, run the following:

        ```
        credhub set -n MY-SET-CERTIFICATE -t certificate -r /tmp/ca.yml -c /tmp/certificate.yml -p /tmp/private_key.yml
        ```
        Where `MY-SET-CERTIFICATE` is the name of the manually set certificate you want to reset.
        <br><br>
        For example:
        <pre class="terminal">
        $ credhub set -n /services/tls_ca -t certificate -r /tmp/ca.yml -c /tmp/certificate.yml -p /tmp/private_key.yml
        </pre>
   * If the retrieved certificate is an intermediate or leaf certificate, run the following:

        ```
        credhub set -n MY-SET-CERTIFICATE -t certificate -c /tmp/certificate.yml -p /tmp/private_key.yml -m NAME-OF-SIGNING-CA
        ```
        Where:
        * `MY-SET-CERTIFICATE` is the name of the manually set certificate you want to reset.
        * `NAME-OF-SIGNING-CA` is the name of the signing root CA certificate.
        <br><br>
        For example:
        <pre class="terminal">
        $ credhub set -n /opsmgr/cf-123455677890/some_service_certificate -t certificate -c /tmp/certificate.yml -m /services/tls_ca
        </pre>

title: Adding a Custom Certificate Authority

This topic describes how to add a custom certificate authority (CA) to issue CA certificates in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployment.

## <a id='overview'></a>Custom CA Overview
To secure traffic in your PCF deployment, you must provide a CA to issue CA certificates. 
Pivotal recommends you provide a CA certificate from a known CA when using a production environment. When you add and activate a new CA, a CA certificate is issued to BOSH Director. 
BOSH Director then passes the certificate to other components in your PCF deployment. 

Use the below procedures to add and activate a new CA.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can also use the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) interface to issue certificates signed by the Ops Manager CA. However, you should use only use this locally-issued CA in testing and development environments. 
For more information on creating a Pivotal-generated CA, see <a href= "https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/opsguide/security_config.html#create_or_obtain_certs"> Creating a Wildcard Certificate for PCF Deployments</a>.</p>

## <a id='add'></a>Step 1: Add a Custom CA

When adding a custom CA, you must have access to your User Account and Authentication (UAA) access token. Perform the steps in [User Account and Authentication (UAA) Server
](../../concepts/architecture/uaa.html) topic to target and authenticate with the Ops Manager UAA server. Record your Ops Manager access token.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When you record your Ops Manager access token, remove any new line characters such as <code>/n</code>. Otherwise the API call in the following step will not succeed.</p>

You can add a new CA by using the following API calls and the `curl` command: 

1. Use `curl` to make the following API call:
    <pre>
    $ curl "http<span>s:</span>//OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities" \
        -X POST \ 
        -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ 
        -d '{"cert_pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\EXAMPLE-CERTIFICATE", "private_key_pem": "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\EXAMPLE-KEY"}'
    </pre>
    Replace `EXAMPLE-CERTIFICATE` with your custom CA certificate and `EXAMPLE-KEY` with your custom RSA key.           

    The APl call returns a response that includes the new CA certificate:
    <pre class="terminal">
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    {
      "certificate_authorities": [
        {
          "guid": "f7bc18f34f2a7a9403c3",
          "issuer": "YOUR-CA",
          "created_on": "2017-01-09",
          "expires_on": "2021-01-09",
          "active": true,
          "cert_pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIC+zCCAeOgAwIBAgI....etc"
        }
      ]
    }
  </pre>
1. Confirm that you have added your new CA by listing all of the root CAs for Ops Manager:
  <pre>
  $ curl "http<span>s:</span>//OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities" \
        -X GET \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
  </pre>

    The API call returns a response listing all of the root CAs:
    <pre class="terminal">
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    {
      "certificate_authorities": [
        {
          "guid": "f7bc18f34f2a7a9403c3",
          "issuer": "YOUR-CA",
          "created_on": "2017-01-09",
          "expires_on": "2021-01-09",
          "active": false,
          "cert_pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIC+zCCAeOgAwIBAgI....etc"
        }
      ]
    }
    </pre>
  Confirm that your new CA has `active` set to `false`. Record its GUID.

1. Navigate to `https://OPS-MAN-FQDN` in a browser and log in to Ops Manager.
1. Click **Apply Changes**. When the deploy finishes, continue to the next section.

## <a id='activate-new-ca'></a> Step 2: Activate the New CA

After adding your CA you must activate it. Once the CA is activated, the CA issues a CA certificate to BOSH Director. 

1. Use `curl` to make an API call to activate the new CA. 
Replace `CERT-GUID` with the GUID of your CA that you retrieved in the previous section:
  <pre>$ curl "http<span>s</span>://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities/CERT-GUID/activate" \
      -X POST \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{}' 
  </pre> 
  If the API call succeed, it returns a successful response:
  <pre class="terminal">HTTP/1.1 200 OK</pre>

1. List your root CAs to confirm that the new CA is active:
<pre>
  $ curl "http<span>s:</span>//OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities" \
        -X GET \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
  </pre>
 Confirm that your new CA has `active` set to `true`.
1. Navigate to Ops Manager and click **Apply Changes**.
